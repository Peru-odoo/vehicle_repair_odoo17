I hope I get this job , I don't want to think about my mental state and all
I should be thinking  how to  get this job and make money and support my parents financially
God Please I hope they select me and put me in nice group where I can learn and actually become
perfect at coding and start to enjoy work or get interested
 And if I don't get selected then I will think you have protected me from here

Don't stress kid what if You don't need to do coding all those 11 days

 Write the concept you learned these days:

 1) CONTEXT:
 * Using the Context to pass default values for fields
 <field name="employee_id" context="{'default_company_id' : company_id}">

 * Using context in search view and filters.

 * Using Context in Window actions

 2) DOMAIN:
  domain="[(field_name, 'operator', ‘value’)]"

* Using domain in a search view filter.
* Using domain in record rule.

3) FILTERED, MAPPED AND SORTED:

i. sorted(): To sort a recordset
# sort records by name
recset.sorted(key=lambda r: r.name)

ii. filtered(): To filter a recordset:

# only keep records whose company is the current user's
records.filtered(lambda r: r.company_id == user.company_id)

# only keep records whose partner is a company
records.filtered("partner_id.is_company")

iii. mapped(): To map a recordset by applying the provided function to each record in the recordset
and returns a recordset if the results are recordsets.

recordset.mapped(lambda record: record.amount + record.tax_amount)

# returns a list of name
recset.mapped('name')

# returns a recordset of partners
recset.mapped('invoice_id.partner_id')

4) DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ONCHANGE AND COMPUTE:


5) TYPES OF ACTIONS IN ODOO:
i. Server Actions (ir.actions.server) :

ii. Client Actions (ir.actions.client)

iii. Automatic Actions (ir.cron)

iv. URL Actions (ir.actions.act_url)

v. Report Actions (ir.actions.report)

vi. Window Actions ( ir.actions.act_window )
